Liva X (2GB/32GB varient)
BIOS v2.16.1242
OS : Arch (Minimal) with Wireless and Wired connections configured. Pretty stock
install, no grub/ kernel parameter hacks.

Following settings in BIOS work making this box boot headless (without dummy
plug, these setting were applied AFTER resetting BIOS to ‘Optimized Defaults’
(press F3)):

Boot ->
Operating System Select = Manual
OS Selection (ACPI) = Windows 8.x
Boot -> CSM configuration
CSM Support = Enabled

had success booting Debian 8 (Jessie) also in headless mode, which was again a
console only install.
