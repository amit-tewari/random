# Getting Started with typesetting and document processing with troff and mom

### Canonical reference materials

The canonical reference materials for groff are [cstr54](https://www.troff.org/54.pdf) (a downloadable PostScript copy of which is available here) and the troff and groff_diff manpages. The most complete and up-to-date source of information is the groff info pages, available by typing info groff at the command line (assuming you have the TeXinfo standalone browser installed on your system, which is standard for most GNU/Linux distributions). And for inputting special characters, see man groff_char.
